This Laravel API project demonstrates basic CRUD operations using the Repository pattern, with seeders, validations, and tests.

You can find the Postman requests in a JSON file available at:
[Postman JSON File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BsvvEc0Ae2yO6DQQJ8KVrfonL8jp1mBD/view?usp=sharing)

To load the seeders, use the command:
```
php artisan make:fresh --seed
```

To run the local server, execute:
```
php artisan serve
```

Feel free to explore and look around.
